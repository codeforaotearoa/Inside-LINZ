Yeah, I’ve just had my brain overloaded with all the wonderous services provided by <a href="http://linz.govt.nz" target="_blank" rel="external">Land Information New Zealand</a></p>
<p><strong><strong>Title card drops from the ceiling</strong></strong></p>
<p>This is a blog post, not a TV show…</p>
<h3 id="Oops-wrong-format-haha-So-I-heard-you’ve-started-off-on-this-whole-Code-for-Aotearoa-business-What’s-the-deal-with-that"><a href="#Oops-wrong-format-haha-So-I-heard-you’ve-started-off-on-this-whole-Code-for-Aotearoa-business-What’s-the-deal-with-that" class="headerlink" title="Oops, wrong format, haha!

So, I heard you’ve started off on this whole Code for Aotearoa business? What’s the deal with that?</h3><p>So! Before we talk about Code for Aotearoa, let’s learn about Code for All.</p>
<h3 id="Ah-the-ol’-bait-and-switch"><a href="#Ah-the-ol’-bait-and-switch" class="headerlink" title="Ah, the ol’ bait and switch?"></a>Ah, the ol’ bait and switch?</h3><p>Shush, this is my blog and I’ll write it however I feel like!</p>
<p><em>ahem</em></p>
<p>Once upon a time, well, no actually instead of retreading old ground, I’ll just refer you over to the <a href="https://medium.com/code-for-aotearoa/why-code-for-aotearoa-a4c865ff7122#.vhjc5i5wp" target="_blank" rel="external">post</a> that <a href="http://twitter.com/peterjakey" target="_blank" rel="external">Pete</a> wrote last week.</p>
<h3 id="Cheater"><a href="#Cheater" class="headerlink" title="Cheater"></a>Cheater</h3><p>Well, it’s more efficient I reckon. So, how about I tell you all about LINZ.</p>
<h3 id="Whoa-there-pal-we’ve-just-started-Maybe-take-it-easy-and-just-tell-me-one-cool-thing-you-learned"><a href="#Whoa-there-pal-we’ve-just-started-Maybe-take-it-easy-and-just-tell-me-one-cool-thing-you-learned" class="headerlink" title="Whoa there pal, we’ve just started! Maybe take it easy and just tell me one cool thing you learned"></a>Whoa there pal, we’ve just started! Maybe take it easy and just tell me one cool thing you learned</h3><p>Hmm, yeah, considering this post is already half a week late, you’re probably right. Weird, it’s like you can almost read my mind.</p>
<p>Anyway, how do you feel about Hydrography?</p>
<h3 id="Hydrowhat"><a href="#Hydrowhat" class="headerlink" title="Hydrowhat?"></a>Hydrowhat?</h3><p>Hydrography!</p>
<p>The study of water bodies, like lakes, rivers and even the ocean.</p>
<p>It’s such a cool word, huh? Just kinda feels nice to say</p>
<h3 id="What’s-cool-about-water"><a href="#What’s-cool-about-water" class="headerlink" title="What’s cool about water?"></a>What’s cool about water?</h3><p>The temperature</p>
<p><a href="http://instantrimshot.com" target="_blank" rel="external"><em>ba dum tiss</em></a></p>
<p>No but they do a lot of interesting stuff. They’re responsible for mapping the sea. Without that information, you’d have people unaware of the depths and shallows which means a lot of beached ships.</p>
<p>They also are in charge of the NAVAREA alerts. Psst, ask me “What are NAVAREA alerts? It looks good when you do the big text”</p>
<h3 id="What-are-NAVAREA-alerts-It-looks-good-when-you-do-the-big-text"><a href="#What-are-NAVAREA-alerts-It-looks-good-when-you-do-the-big-text" class="headerlink" title="What are NAVAREA alerts? It looks good when you do the big text"></a>What are NAVAREA alerts? It looks good when you do the big text</h3><p>Oh, I put my ending quote mark in the wrong place, oops.</p>
<p>NAVAREAs are basically specific areas that get assigned to a government where it becomes their job to issue warnings for things like weather warnings, loose icebergs and missile launches.</p>
<h3 id="Missile-Excuse-me"><a href="#Missile-Excuse-me" class="headerlink" title="Missile? Excuse me?"></a>Missile? Excuse me?</h3><p>Yup, there have been a few cases where foreign countries have conducted missile launches in the oceans administered by LINZ.</p>
<p>Generally they’ll receive an email and if the warning is considered notable then within the short time of 2 hours, the following will happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>The team will generate a small piece of text, intended to be beamed out to mariners</li>
<li>That message is sent to Kordia who will also record a voice over to accompany the text</li>
<li>Both are beamed up to a satellite where the message is redirected down towards our oceans so that mariners are able to receive the broadcast on their radios and other equipment</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Wow-that’s-actually-really-interesting"><a href="#Wow-that’s-actually-really-interesting" class="headerlink" title="Wow, that’s actually really interesting"></a>Wow, that’s actually really interesting</h3><p>I told you! Keep in mind though that while there are recreational mariners, it’s the big commercial trawlers and what not who get the most use out of the broadcasts.</p>
<p>Well, that said, there’s actually a lot of things they’re required to carry under law but that’s a different story.</p>
<p>Hopefully you found this all as facinating as I did!</p>
<p>Until next week which, well, actually is just this week so double blog posts since mine was so late, haha.</p>
<p>The first week was all pretty hectic but hopefully we should be able to pick up the slack a bit and get lots of good tweets and that going on!</p>
